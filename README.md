# Cinema-Manager
A program that allows users to purchase tickets at a movie theater. The user is given the option to search for showing movies by movie or by date. Once the user selects a specific showtime, the user is taken to another menu that allows them to view seats or purchase tickets. For efficiency, the showtime id number (which is unique for every showing) is passed from the database to the customer interface. User choice is associated with the showtime id and it is this id that is used to get the specific seating chart associated with that showtime. When purchasing tickets, the user selects their seats and only when the user confirms their choice is the seating chart in the database updated. For simplicity, the seating chart is represented as a string. This string is passed along from the database to the program and an updated string is sent back to the database.
